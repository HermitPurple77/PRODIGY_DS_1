# 🌍 Global Population Analysis with Power BI

This repository contains a Power BI dashboard that visualizes the **distribution and growth of the world population by country and year**, using data sourced from the **World Bank**.

## 📊 Project Overview

As part of my internship at **Prodigy InfoTech**, I developed an interactive dashboard to analyze and present population trends across countries over time. This project showcases my ability to clean, model, and visualize real-world datasets using **Microsoft Power BI**.

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source**: [World Bank – Total Population (SP.POP.TOTL)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL)
- **Data Format**: Excel (`.xls`)
- **Time Range**: 1960 – 2023
- **Columns Used**: Country Name, Country Code, Year, Population

## 🧠 Key Features

- Bar chart showing population by country and year
- Grouping countries into population categories:  
  `<10M`, `10M–50M`, `50M–100M`, `>100M`
- Slicer for dynamic year selection
- Clean, minimal layout for easy insights

## 📌 Skills Applied

- Data cleaning and transformation with Power Query
- Unpivoting year-based columns into rows
- Creating calculated columns for grouping
- Building dynamic visuals and slicers
- Real-world application of data visualization principles

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/)
- Excel (`.xls` dataset)
- Power Query Editor
